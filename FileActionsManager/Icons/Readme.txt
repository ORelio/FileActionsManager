= Developer's note =

After compiling FileActionsManager.exe, the icon groups need to be added manually
using Resource Hacker: http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/

MAIN (1033) => Mattahan-Buuf-MDI-Text-Editor.ico
MENU (1033) => Mattahan-Buuf-Menu.ico

Visual Studio do not offer easy embedding of more than 1 native icon group resource,
so adding it manually is the most simple and straightforward way.
